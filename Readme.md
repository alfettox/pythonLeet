## Introduction

This project implements an algorithm to find and visualize islands on a 2D grid. The grid is represented as a list of lists where '1' represents land and '0' represents water. The algorithm identifies connected regions of '1's as islands.


The algorithm follows a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the grid and identify connected regions. The discovery process is visualized using Matplotlib.
